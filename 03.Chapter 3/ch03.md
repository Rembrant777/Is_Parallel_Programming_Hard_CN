Hardware and its Habits 
硬件及其特性

Most people intuitively understand that passing messages between systems is more expensive than performing simple calculations within the confines of a single system. 
大多数人会下意识认为系统间进行消息的传输所带来的系统开销要远高于单节点计算机上执行简单的计算. 


But it is also the case that communicating among threads within the confines of a single shared-memory system can also be quite expensive. 
但是同样在这个问题范畴内, 单个计算节点上多线程间彼此间竟有共享内存系统进行的通信其所带来的资源开销也同样高昂. 

This chapter therefore looks at the cost of synchornization and communication within a shared-memory system. 
所以本章就围绕(单个计算节点上的)在共享内存系统上所执行的同步操作与沟通所带来的系统开销来展开.  

These few pages can do no more than scratch the surface of shared-memory parallel hardware design; 
这一章节中的几页呢, 对于设计硬件中涉及到共享内存并行这个话题简直就是隔靴搔痒. 

readers desiring more detail would do well to start with a recent edition of Hennessy’s and Patterson’s classic text. 
渴望了解更多细节的读者可以去阅读 Hennessy’s 与 Patterson 最新版的经典书籍.

3.1: Why should parallel programmers bother learning low-level properties of the hardware ? 
Wouldn’t it be easier, better, and more elegant to remain at a higher level of abstraction ? 
3.1: 为什么并行开发者不厌其烦的学习硬件底层的知识, 而不将时间投入到更加简单, 高效且优雅的高层抽象设计层级上?
